#Dancing Squares Game

Use html, js and css to make an interactive space where random 'objects' are created with each click of the buttons

-Update
I'm now aiming to make a game where you move your box into a larger one that randomly changes place, size and color as you progress

-How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JS

Planning to impliment a button to remove 'objects' as well

-Update
To start I'm going to redefine the game space to change the existing box to become a scoring zone and add a box to represent the player that can be moved. Scoring and win/loss conditions to follow

-Optimizations

-Lessons Learned

-Update
I've already learned that setting the scope and thouroughly defining a project from square one really really helps to get it to a 'completion' and iterable point faster and to get closer to your original goal.
